## Checklist is an efficient way for anyone to manage their task work effectively, with a clean and simple interface designed for 
optimal user interaction. A user is able to define and add any text based task to a list that clearly outlines the needed tasks in 
the order in which they were added. Additionally, a user is able to toggle whether a task has been completed or not, with a correspondingly understandable change in visuals for the task list. A user is also able to delete any unwanted tasks within list. Finally, the application allows the user to traverse multiple pages that were implemented using react-router (about - description of the application and the devoloper, login - allows the user to form a checklist handle (username) that opens up the ability to edit the text on tasks and profile - details the users handle information) and most importantly, the users data is persisted across the local storage for the webpage, allowing the user to reload, close/reopen, etc the application and still maintain the needed data to remake their custom checklist.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
